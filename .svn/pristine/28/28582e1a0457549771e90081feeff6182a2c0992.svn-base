!!Application: %color=#ff7f00%'''pEchoVar'''%%
[[<<]]
!!!!Function:
The pEchoVar application is a lightweight process that runs without any user interaction for ``echoing'' the posting of specified variable-value pairs with a follow-on posting having different variable name. For example the posting of @@FOO=5.5@@ could be echoed such that @@BAR=5.5@@ is posted on the very iteration that the incoming mail is received.
