 
To build the software in this "moos-ivp" repository, first
build the MOOS software:

$ ./build-moos.sh

The above should only need to be done once upon an initial 
checkout from the SVN server

Thereafter the ivp tree can be build by:

$ ./build-ivp.sh

See the README file in moos-ivp/ivp/src for more specific
build info regarding that tree.
