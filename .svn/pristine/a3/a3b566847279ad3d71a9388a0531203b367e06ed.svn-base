o MOOS mission file reader: Verbatim quoting not work. 
  See m10_jake, plug_uFldHazardMgr

o uFldHazardSensor - docs reflect simplified reporting metric?
  - Still reporting an unhandled Mail for early sensor request.

o pMarineViewer, uMACView: The ( and ) keys should make appcast font bigger/smaller.

o uXMS could support a history mode where duplicate items are given a separate line, to indicate frequency of posts.

o Overload the Notify and OnNewMail to keep track of most recent incoming
and outgoing postings. AppCast Viewers can go into an alternative mode (verbose?)
where all recent mail (Most recent 20?) gets appended to the end of the report.

[Iteration 349]----------------------------------
IN  CRS_RANGE_REQUEST = foobar
    NAV_X
    NAV_Y
    NAV_X
    NAV_Y
OUT RESULT = foobar
    STATUS = ok
[Iteration 353]----------------------------------
IN  CRS_RANGE_REQUEST = foobar
    NAV_X
    NAV_Y
    NAV_X
    NAV_Y
OUT RESULT = foobar
    STATUS = ok
 

o MOOS - how hard would it be to allow config params over multiple lines, 
  that is, GetConfigParams does this behind the scenes for us.

o add ability in uPokeDB to poke a timewarped MOOSDB. Preferably autodetect,
  but at the very least, accept on the command line the timewarp arg.

o Add example mission suggestions for all -e cmdline flags

o uMAC - when a run warning is retracted, a new report is not sent to the 
  terminal.
o uMAC - When in the EVENTS mode, and a run warning is received, the terminal
  contents are not refreshed.


o uFldNodeComms could use a look, events, runwarnings etc properly? buildreport?
o Talk to paaul a pShare_INPUT_SUMMARY
o uXMS doesn't seem to be doing much error checking in OnStartUp()

o uFldHazardMetric should post "of possible best" in report.
  When only metrics are Pfa, Pmd, best score is ZERO
o Add gaussian noise to uFldNodeComms? Range requirement +/- noise?
o In ALL uFldSimSensors, put in a revokable runwarning when/if a sensor 
  or config request comes before the first NODE_REPORT

  - Protocol should be
    client: repeatedly request config
            upon ack, begin requesting sensor readings
    client should probably support a condition. When condition is true
    request sensor readings, otherwise remain quiet. Think acomms issues.

o uFldHazardSensor: reimplement 2Pass implemention in onstartup to ensure default
  values are applied when a hazard is added.

o AppCast: Can we send ac::endl instead of "\n". Less of a hack and could 
  internally be represented by something other than a CRLF, making for better
  viewing in uXMS and logfiles.

o AppCast run warnings should also keep time stamp of the latest warning of each type:

  [23][238.3] No configuration for charlie
  ...
  [24][258.1] No configuration for charlie
  ...

o uFldHazardMetric - no checks for confg warnings (AC enabled? NO)

o pHelmIvP: come back to HelmIvP::processNodeReport. name,x,y,time should work?
o pMarineViewer doesn't seem to catch config errors very well
o pHelmIvP should do a better job of reporting config errors
o pHelmIvP should post run-time error tied to BHV_ERROR
o AppCast should include scope on behavior condition vars, or 
  mode vars. Special status to spawning vars?
o AppCast should report on behavior templates and how many time
  each one has been spawned. and/or is currently spawned.

o dynamic uXMS:
  - will register for a new variable, or new app, specified incoming mail
  - pMarineViewer/uMacView can accept a user input and it will send the 
    generic uXMS request to the currently selected vehicle.

o pBasicContactMgr
  - cpa range does not seem to be work in m3_casar
  - Is the below config valid? (uex u3_clay config didntwork)
  Alert = var=CONTACT_INFO, val="name=$[VNAME] # contact=$[VNAME]"
  Alert = var=TRAIL_INFO, val="name=trail_$[VNAME] # contact=$[VNAME]"
  Alert = var=CONTACT_$[VTYPE], val="name=avd_$[VNAME] # contact_type=$[VTYPE]"
  - If its not valid, it should show as config warning

o What about having "events" in AppCasts be displayed as a different color in 
  uMAC*, with a default timeout of 2 real seconds, but overridable to longer or
  zero in the originating app?

o  uXMS could display / - \ | / - in the time column when not expanded 
   and things changing
    - or * < 1 sec   or  .
        @ < 2 sec        .
        - < 5 sec         .
o we could use a generic protobuf class

o MOOSDB: would be nice if the DB could keep a limited history of all variables.
  Logger will miss certain postings if started too late.

o pMarineViewer: Restore "reference" functionality? 
  Make Reference vehicle menu additions automatic so Vehicle names don't need to 
  be specified in the pMarineViewer config block (Simplifies mission config/launch
  if shoreside community does NOT have to know the names of vehicles!!!!)

o pMarineViewer: set_pan_x should be deprecated as a config parameter. Should be able
  to set the center of the screen: set_center_x=100, set_center_y=212
