\section{Introduction}
\label{into}
This document is designed for people who want to use the graphical tools included in MOOS/IvP.  It assumes that the reader is familiar with starting and running a MOOS mission and with basic usage of a GUI.  It also assumes that the tools are fully compiled and functional.  In Section~\ref{pMarineViewer}, usage and configuration of \pmv\ is described.  In Section~\ref{polyview}, the mission planning tool polyview is described.  Finally, some of the examples are shown in the appendices.
