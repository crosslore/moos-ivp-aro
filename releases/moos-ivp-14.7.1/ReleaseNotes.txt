13.5.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

pHelmIvP

* Behaviors are augmented via an additional overloadable function,
onHelmStart(), executed by the behavior upon helm startup. This allows
behaviors, defined as templates and thus not spawned until later, to
post info to the MOOSDB that may affect the conditions of their
spawning. For example, the collision avoidance behavior posts a
request for alerts of a certain form, to pBasicContactMgr.

* BHV_AvoidCollision - fixed bug in handling marker configurations

* BHV_AvoidObstacles - Several improvements to improve robustness against thrashing. 

* BHV_Waypoint - Added ability to configure the "next waypoint" visual point size

* BHV_Waypoint - Added minor new capability to specify the order
parameter with the with the value "toggle". To do this the Helm also
had to be slightly modified to now allow successive duplicate updates
messages to go through if the update string passes the case
insensitive check for containing the word "toggle".

* BHV_StationKeep - Minor mod to BHV_StationKeep to allow label colors to be set

* BHV_RubberBand - Improvements merged from the DARPA branch

* BHV_Trail - Modified to NOT render the trail point in the idle state

* BHV_Trail - Udpated for idle state posting of trail distance

* BHV_MaxDepth - Added new behavior to limit the maximum depth allowed. 

* Fixed minor bug where completed behaviors were not being retained in the 
list of completed behaviors between helm iterations. Now they are persistent.

* Fixed issue in the helm where duplicate behavior names would result 
    in the helm not starting, rather than the helm being in the MALCONFIG state

* Fixed bug in IvPBehavior duration timer that caused initial durations to 
    be erroneously long on the first invocation if duration_idle_decay is set to false

* Bug fix to the BehaviorSet startup handler, could cause malconfig behavior 
    to segfault on startup instead of throw an error warning on startup


pMarineViewer
  - Added wamv shape to possible lists of vehicles allowed.


pHostInfo
  - mod to pHostInfo to allow all the system commands to run in the foreground 
    to allow them time to complete before attempt to read the tmp files

=============================================================================
uTimerScript

* Fixed bug where setting configuring paused=true was not being respected. 
* Fixed bug where setting delay_start=N was not being handled properly
* Fixed bug where setting delay_reset=N was not being handled properly

* Added ability to have the script block until another named app(s) have been detected in the DB_CLIENTS list. See the block_on parameter.

* Added ability to add a "multi-event". For example, the line

  event = var=VALUE, val="id=$[IDX]", time=0, amt=3
    
is the same as having three config lines with

    event = var=VALUE, val="id=$[IDX]", time=0
    event = var=VALUE, val="id=$[IDX]", time=0
    event = var=VALUE, val="id=$[IDX]", time=0

* Added further parameter checking to ensure random variables provide a 
  legal keyname.




uSimMarine

* Fixed bug regarding USM_SIM_PAUSED

iSay

* New MOOS app for invoking the native speech generation utilities of OSX 
    (the say command) and GNU/Linux (the espeak command).

lib_geometry

* Added turnsLeft turnsRight check to the CPA engine for use in COLREGS behaviors

nsplug

* Augmented to support #ifdef A B  where B could also be an incoming MACRO. For example 
    #ifdef VNAME VNAME1 in meta_vehicle.bhv in the kasper-jake mission

uFldMessageHandler

* minor mod to uFldMessageHandler to allow control over appcasting
output.  User can configure whether reported successful messages are
truncated or not when shown on the appcast report. No effect on
messaging functionality.  The parameter is "appcast_trunc_msg=75". 75
is the default. If set to 0 no truncation will be applied.

alogscan

* Added -l,--loglist command line option to list all the logged variables in a format suitable for configuring pLogger.

aloghelm

* Added -b,--bhvs option for showing helm behavior state changes

* Added -m,--modes option for showing helm mode changes

* Added --watch=bhv option to watch a particular behavior for state changes

uFldHazardSensor

* Added ability to disable hazard resemblance factors with parameter ignore_resemblances=true

* minor mod to regard the UHZ_SENSOR_REQUEST as a request lasting 120
seconds.  Sensor user no longer needs to repeatedly post this
request. Just more often than once per 120 seconds. This 120 value may
become a parameter in the future. Aids in distributed uField setups
where the occasional UHZ_SENSOR_REQUEST is dropped.

* Added enforcement for max vehicle speed, above which the sensor will
be off.  The default value is 2.0 m/s. Adjustable with "max_vehicle_speed" parameter.

* Augmented with the ingore_resemblances option


uXMS

* Modified to better handle registration for all variables using the
new MOOS wildcard capability. Fixed minor bug where uXMS erroneously
posted a configuration warning if if the MOOS community was not
provided via a mission file.

uPokeDB 

* Minor mod to handle command line args --host= and --port= in a manner more consistent with other MOOS-IvP apps.

pBasicContactMgr

* It now accepts alert configurations via the incoming MOOS Variable BCM_ALERT_REQUEST

lib_ivpbuild

* Minor fixes to remove extraneous semicolons in a few files, comply with stricter compiler
  constraints.

uLoadWatch

* A new application to monitor the reported ITER_GAP and ITER_LEN information produced
  by all AppCastingMOOSApp applications.

pNodeReporter

*   Augmented to register for LOAD_WARNING messages (from the new uLoadWatch app), and 
  include them in node reports if one is found.





------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pHelmIvP
  - Better support for BEHAVIOR_DIRS 
    relative path in behavior files? (../../)
    support for ~ in behavior files? (~/mybhvs)

uXMS
  - should have an optional config where (S) (T) (C) are not shown, to 
    maximize column width for the value info

uFldHazardSensor
  - should send a heartbeat/status message to the vehicle to indicate that 
    it's sensor is off (e.g. due to turning etc)

uFldPathCheck
  - Should monitor top speed and disqualify (to uFldHazardMetric) if top 
    vehicle speed is violated.

pMarineViewer
  - should be able to click on a vehicle in an appcast window and DELETE it. 
    all node report histories gone, all geometry objects erased etc.

pNodeReporter
  - should detect when a key component has become stale and post a run warning
  
uPokeDB 
  - should allow a time warp argument (if it's needed?)

nsplug
  - If an undefined macro is found on a particular line, along with other well-defined
    macros, the well-defined macros should be filled in, rather than just ignoring
    the entire line.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pMarineViewer
  - fixed bug in handling marker configurations
  - Improved runwarning information when receiving a partial/bad node report

pHelmIvP
  - HSLine behavior - fixed bug where empty VIEW_SEGLIST was being posted on 
    startup and triggering a warning in pMarineViewer

  - Fixed bug in the helm appcasting scope output. Elements of type double 
    incorrectly posting zero regardless of actual value. Did not affect the
    behavior of the vehicle, but was confusing if using the appcast scoping
    output for debugging or mission monitoring.

uFldHazardSensor
  - Added further options for interaction with the classify queue. Users now
    have the option to specify a priority along with the classify request, and
    the ability to request an emergency request, and the ability to simply
    clear the queue of all prior requests.
  - Added ability to handle aspect-sensitive objets. Sensor will degrade the
    when a vehicle is not approaching an object at its optimal aspect angle
  - Fixed bug in setting the max limits to swath width settings.

gen_hazards
  - Added ability to generate hazards with aspect sensitivity

uFldNodeComms
  - Modification to make the handling of groups names be case insensitive.

uFldHazardMetric
  - Fixed a bug in initializing the normalized score range.

uFldShoreBroker
  - Does not post a run warning when/if it detects a stale vehicle, unless
    explicitly configured with warning_on_stale=true
  - Corrected the --interface output to reflect usage with pShare instead of
    pMOOSBridge
  - improved robustness when incoming node changes its declared IP address


uFldNodeBroker
  - Corrected the --interface output to reflect usage with pShare instead of
    pMOOSBridge

alogscan
  - Fixed bug where alog file name was converted to lower case and thus not 
    working in Linux.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13.2.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
uFldHazardSensor 
  - Re-added the capability to limit classification requests
    based on a fixed interval of time (configured by "min_classify_interval")
  - Added ability to switch Pd settings as often as desired.

uXMS 
  - removed debug output in the --all mode
  - fixed bug that affected uXMS operation in AppCasting 

pMarineViewer
  - more robustness checking/handling for edge cases in MOOSGeodesy that was
    causing pMarineViewer crashes in some Linux distros, e.g., Ubuntu 12.10
  - fixed bug that caused left/right mouse context collisions when there was
    a context id shared by both the left and right mouse context config.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13.2.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BHV_Waypoint - added the wptflag parameter to support user-configured posting of 
   flags upon arriving at each waypoint. This allows easy configuration of a 
   mission where the the vehicle stops and station-keeps at each waypoint for 
   a sensor measurement. The wptflag parameter may also embed the location of the
   waypoint, for example "wptflag = NEW_POINT=$[X],$[Y]"

pMarineViewer - support for tiff_viewable=false to allow users to bring up 
   the viewer without the background image at startup.

lib_geometry - added type and source back to the XYObject.h definition. Was making
   backward compatibility too hard for folks.

uXMS info: --serverport, --serverhost are the correct parameters
     info *had* shown that the parameters were server_host and server_port

uXMS - fixed colormap parameter handling. "colormap" is the correct parameter. It 
     is now reflected properly in the --example output. For convenience though, 
     both colormap and color_map are supported.

uXMS - Fixed a bug where proper history_var specifications where still being
    reported as a configuration warning.

pHelmIvP - Fixed a bug where even proper IVP_BEHAVIOR_DIR parameter settings were 
   being flagged with a configuration warning.

pBasicContactMgr:
  - Fixed bug in linear extrapolation calculations of stale contacts
  - changed contact default retirement time to 600 secs (from 3600)
  - CONTACT_RECAP now does NOT include retired contacts
  - Added extrapolation decay and config parameter for overriding default (30,60)
  - Changed CONTACTS_RECAP to publish once per 5 seconds by default, overridable with the 
    the recap_min_interval config parameter
