o Nov1709: IvPBehavior::postWMessage() modified to NOT post a warning
  when passed an empty string.

o Nov1709: Modified uTimerScript to support --help, and report a Usage
  message when no .moos file is provided (standard practice across
  apps). MINOR FIX

o Nov1709: Modified BHV_ConstantSpeed to accept a summit_delta 
  parameter specification. MINOR IMPROVEMENT

o Nov1709: Modified BHV_ConstantSpeed to return BHV_ERROR in the 
  case where an IvP function generation fails, and post warnings
  in the case where the ZAIC produces warnings. MINOR FIX

o Nov1709: Modified BHV_ConstantDepth to return BHV_ERROR in the 
  case where an IvP function generation fails, and post warnings
  in the case where the ZAIC produces warnings. MINOR FIX

o Nov1709: Modified BHV_ConstantHeading to accept a summit_delta 
  parameter specification. MINOR IMPROVEMENT

o Nov1709: Modified BHV_ConstantHeading to return BHV_ERROR in the 
  case where an IvP function generation fails, and post warnings
  in the case where the ZAIC produces warnings. MINOR FIX

o Nov1709: Modified ZAIC_PEAK to be more gracious in accepting 
  parameters. For example, basewidth, peakwidth < 0 is clipped
  to zero and a warning is generated, rather than declaring the 
  ZAIC to be in a broken state and unable to produce an function.
  This issue was biting folks in the field where a basewidth was
  inadvertantly set to <zero due to being tied to vehicle altitude.
  Although this should be caught in the behavior, it seems the 
  ZAIC was unnecessarily harsh in dealing with this.

o Nov1709: Removed BHV_ConstantDepth::handleConditionalParam() as
  it was never fully implemented or used.

o Nov1709: Modified BHV_Shadow to check for ZAIC failures and 
  post warnings and a BHV_ERROR in case of errors. Also enforced
  that max_range parameter must be a non-negative numerical val.
