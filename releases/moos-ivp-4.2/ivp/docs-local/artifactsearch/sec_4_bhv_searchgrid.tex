\section{\bhvsg}
\label{bhvSearchGrid}
THIS SECTION IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT.

The \bhvsg\ used in the example mission (See Section~\ref{examples}) is Mike Benjamin's BHV\_SearchGrid.  It uses a simple heuristic that tries to visit each cell for a specified period of time (approximately 7 seconds).  It does not communicate with other vehicles, but when used in conjunction with other behaviors (such as ConstantHeading and ConstantSpeed), it explores the search grid adequately.

Andrew Shafer is currently developing BHV\_SearchArtifact to allow inter-vehicle communication.  The behavior (and pSensorSim) should also allow different sensor models and change its behavior based on these models.
