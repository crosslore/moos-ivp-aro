#!/bin/sh

# This script launches the specified program within its application bundle.
# We launch the program within its app bundle (rather than using /usr/bin/open)
# because this is the only way (that we know of) that permits us to supply
# command-line arguments.
#
# Although IvP's users could explicitly call the specified program directly,
# we provide this script so that the scripts for launching these programs can
# all be placed in the same directory (ivp/src/bin/mac-osx).  This lets users
# just add this one directory to their PATH, rather than having to add many
# directories ( .../pShipsideViewer.app/Contents/MacOS:.../pMarineViewer.app/...., etc.)
