TODO
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pHelmIvP
  - Better support for BEHAVIOR_DIRS 
    relative path in behavior files? (../../)
    support for ~ in behavior files? (~/mybhvs)

uXMS
  - should have an optional config where (S) (T) (C) are not shown, to 
    maximize column width for the value info

uFldHazardSensor
  - should send a heartbeat/status message to the vehicle to indicate that 
    it's sensor is off (e.g. due to turning etc)

uFldPathCheck
  - Should monitor top speed and disqualify (to uFldHazardMetric) if top 
    vehicle speed is violated.

pMarineViewer
  - should be able to click on a vehicle in an appcast window and DELETE it. 
    all node report histories gone, all geometry objects erased etc.

pNodeReporter
  - should detect when a key component has become stale and post a run warning
  
uPokeDB 
  - should allow a time warp argument (if it's needed?)

nsplug
  - If an undefined macro is found on a particular line, along with other well-defined
    macros, the well-defined macros should be filled in, rather than just ignoring
    the entire line.

13.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pMarineViewer
  - fixed bug in handling marker configurations
  - Improved runwarning information when receiving a partial/bad node report

pHelmIvP
  - HSLine behavior - fixed bug where empty VIEW_SEGLIST was being posted on 
    startup and triggering a warning in pMarineViewer

  - Fixed bug in the helm appcasting scope output. Elements of type double 
    incorrectly posting zero regardless of actual value. Did not affect the
    behavior of the vehicle, but was confusing if using the appcast scoping
    output for debugging or mission monitoring.

uFldHazardSensor
  - Added further options for interaction with the classify queue. Users now
    have the option to specify a priority along with the classify request, and
    the ability to request an emergency request, and the ability to simply
    clear the queue of all prior requests.
  - Added ability to handle aspect-sensitive objets. Sensor will degrade the
    when a vehicle is not approaching an object at its optimal aspect angle
  - Fixed bug in setting the max limits to swath width settings.

gen_hazards
  - Added ability to generate hazards with aspect sensitivity

uFldNodeComms
  - Modification to make the handling of groups names be case insensitive.

uFldHazardMetric
  - Fixed a bug in initializing the normalized score range.

uFldShoreBroker
  - Does not post a run warning when/if it detects a stale vehicle, unless
    explicitly configured with warning_on_stale=true
  - Corrected the --interface output to reflect usage with pShare instead of
    pMOOSBridge


uFldNodeBroker
  - Corrected the --interface output to reflect usage with pShare instead of
    pMOOSBridge

alogscan
  - Fixed bug where alog file name was converted to lower case and thus not 
    working in Linux.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13.2.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
uFldHazardSensor 
  - Re-added the capability to limit classification requests
    based on a fixed interval of time (configured by "min_classify_interval")
  - Added ability to switch Pd settings as often as desired.

uXMS 
  - removed debug output in the --all mode
  - fixed bug that affected uXMS operation in AppCasting 

pMarineViewer
  - more robustness checking/handling for edge cases in MOOSGeodesy that was
    causing pMarineViewer crashes in some Linux distros, e.g., Ubuntu 12.10
  - fixed bug that caused left/right mouse context collisions when there was
    a context id shared by both the left and right mouse context config.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13.2.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BHV_Waypoint - added the wptflag parameter to support user-configured posting of 
   flags upon arriving at each waypoint. This allows easy configuration of a 
   mission where the the vehicle stops and station-keeps at each waypoint for 
   a sensor measurement. The wptflag parameter may also embed the location of the
   waypoint, for example "wptflag = NEW_POINT=$[X],$[Y]"

pMarineViewer - support for tiff_viewable=false to allow users to bring up 
   the viewer without the background image at startup.

lib_geometry - added type and source back to the XYObject.h definition. Was making
   backward compatibility too hard for folks.

uXMS info: --serverport, --serverhost are the correct parameters
     info *had* shown that the parameters were server_host and server_port

uXMS - fixed colormap parameter handling. "colormap" is the correct parameter. It 
     is now reflected properly in the --example output. For convenience though, 
     both colormap and color_map are supported.

uXMS - Fixed a bug where proper history_var specifications where still being
    reported as a configuration warning.

pHelmIvP - Fixed a bug where even proper IVP_BEHAVIOR_DIR parameter settings were 
   being flagged with a configuration warning.

pBasicContactMgr:
  - Fixed bug in linear extrapolation calculations of stale contacts
  - changed contact default retirement time to 600 secs (from 3600)
  - CONTACT_RECAP now does NOT include retired contacts
  - Added extrapolation decay and config parameter for overriding default (30,60)
  - Changed CONTACTS_RECAP to publish once per 5 seconds by default, overridable with the 
    the recap_min_interval config parameter
